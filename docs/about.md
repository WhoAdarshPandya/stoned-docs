## Why

stoned was created by **[Adarsh Pandya](https://github.com/whoadarshpandya/stoned)** as a project for **[neogcamp](https://twitter.com/neogcamp)** . while i was looking for inspiration for the component library i found material-ui, then i looked for package size which was around **5.96mb** and i thought why can't we optimize and deliver the same look and feel but in more optimized manner.
